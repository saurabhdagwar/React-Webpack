React-Webpack
This application is a React-based single-page application (SPA) built and optimized using Webpack. Webpack serves as the module bundler, responsible for compiling, transforming, and packaging all source code, including React components, JavaScript modules, CSS, and other assets, into a single, optimized bundle for efficient delivery and execution in web browsers. This setup provides a highly configurable and performant development environment for the React application.
